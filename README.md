# hello-world
Getting into the world of code :)

Hello everyone, my name is Alejo, I´ve been learning how to code with Python through PyCharm´s enviroment (if that is a correct understanding of the concept). I´m new to the experience of coding, and I´ve enjoyed what I have accomplished by now. I´m willing to improve my skills to contribute to my society and community in a productive way. Programming is a very powerful tool we have as humanity, and we should be using it to improve planet's conditions.
